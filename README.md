# **Quantumsatest** ‚ö°Ô∏è

**Quantumsatest** is a project developed by me that serves as the backend for a website dedicated to managing repair services for electronic equipment. Built with Python, the project uses **FastAPI**, **Uvicorn**, and integrates with a **MySQL database** to handle various operational requirements efficiently.

## **Features** ‚ú®

- **FastAPI Backend**: The application uses **FastAPI**, a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. FastAPI allows for the development of RESTful APIs that are robust, easy to use, and scalable.

- **Uvicorn Server**: The application runs on **Uvicorn**, a lightning-fast ASGI server that enables asynchronous capabilities and handles high loads of traffic efficiently, providing real-time responsiveness.

- **Jinja Templates**: The frontend of the website uses **Jinja**, a templating engine, to dynamically render HTML pages based on data from the backend. Jinja allows for efficient generation of pages, like repair status updates or customer records, based on the data pulled from the MySQL database.

- **MySQL Database Integration**: All data related to repair requests, customer details, equipment, and status are stored and managed through a **MySQL database**, ensuring data consistency and reliability.

- **Repair Management System**: The system tracks repair requests, equipment status updates, customer information, and service history to provide a seamless experience for both customers and business administrators.

- **Scalability**: Built to handle growing traffic, with a modular and scalable design using FastAPI‚Äôs asynchronous capabilities.

- **User Authentication**: Provides role-based authentication to ensure secure access to the admin panel and sensitive data.

- **Flexible API Endpoints**: Customizable and easily extendable API endpoints to handle various operations such as adding new repair jobs, updating job statuses, viewing customer requests, etc.
